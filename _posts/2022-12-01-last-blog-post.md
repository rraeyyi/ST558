Can't believe we are getting toward to the end of the class this semester...

I'm very different with other classmates. Not only I have kid, but also I have almost no background in statistics. Coming back to school and obtaining my second master's in statistics probably is one of the bravest decisions I've ever made for the past 29 years.

When people heard I'm graduate student in statistics. They would say something like 'you must be very smart!'. However, lots of time I feel so upset. There are so many gaps in my knowledge that a master should know. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to make all up. I feel like I spent almost all my efforts to study, the results are always so disappointed. I've asked myself the same question over and over again, 'If it's too hard, what about just quit?'. Now I'm glad I didn't give up. I am gettting close to be a data scientist!

One thing I learnt a hard lesson was backup. So the first thing in the future I would do if I'm using R, I will upload to my personal github in case anyhing unpredictable happens. The second thing I might try will be creating shiny app for visualization and communication. I heard lots of people are using SQL. At least I know using R to generate reports is another great tools to utilize.

I don't have a very clear career plan yet. Hiring freeze makes things lot harder recently. I took basic python on cousera for fun before. I'm hoping to learn more programming language in the future to boost my coding skillsets and combine better with statistics knowledge to really make my reports meaningful. I enrolled big data course for spring semester, hopefully I will learn more hands-on knowledge later.
