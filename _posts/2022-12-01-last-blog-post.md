Can't believe we are getting toward to the end of the class this semester...

I'm very different with other classmates. Not only I have kid, but also I have almost no background in statistics. Coming back to school and obtaining my second master's in statistics probably is one of the bravest decisions I've ever made for the past 29 years.

When people heard I'm graduate student in statistics. They would say something like 'you must be very smart!'. However, lots of time I feel so upset. There are so many gaps in my knowledge that a master should know. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to make all up. I feel like I spent almost all my efforts to study, the results are always so disappointed. I've asked myself the same question over and over again, 'If it's too hard, what about just quit?'. Now I'm glad I didn't give up. I am gettting close to be a data scientist!
