## Difficulties
The hardest part for me is definitely GitHub setups. After trying all the types of solutions, even ereased all my files, I finally make it work.(Actually, it's not that hard.) I guess what makes things complicated was when I googled by the error message, I wan't able to tell what the terminal command actually want to acheive. Then I just simply followed the instruction. (I think I understand better now.) So...

For people who is using macbook, 
In general, the first step is to setup a SSH key on Github.
[How to setup SSH for GitHub on Mac [2022]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZYJKXXMvkM) is great video to start.

After setting up the key, new project -> version control -> Git -> [instead of URL, paste SSH link]

+ "Destination path already exists and is not an empty directory"
ls -a
rm -rf (Project3)
git clone git@github.com:rraeyyi/Project3.git

+ "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit."
cd Project3
git switch yi-changes
git fetch
