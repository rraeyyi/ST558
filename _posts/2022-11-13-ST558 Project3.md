## Difficulties
The hardest part for me is definitely GitHub setups. After trying all the types of solutions, even ereased all my files, I finally make it work.(Actually, it's not that hard.) I guess what makes things complicated was when I googled by the error message, I wan't able to tell what the terminal command actually want to acheive. Then I just simply followed the instruction. (I think I understand better now.) So...

For people who is using macbook,
In general, the first step is to setup a SSH key on Github. [How to setup SSH for GitHub on Mac [2022]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZYJKXXMvkM) is great video to start. After setting up the key, new project -> version control -> Git -> **instead of URL, paste SSH link** 

If you have trouble clone the repo, and the error message was saying "Destination path already exists and is not an empty directory". The solution is:
+ ls -a
+ rm -rf Project3
+ git clone git@github.com:rraeyyi/Project3.git

If you pushed the file but not showing up on Github, you might want to create a new branch. I called mine *yi-changes*. And the message saying "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit." The solution is:
+ cd Project3
+ git switch yi-changes
+ git fetch
