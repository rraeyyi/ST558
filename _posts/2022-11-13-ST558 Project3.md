## Difficulties
The hardest part for me is definitely GitHub setups. After googling all the types of solutions, even ereased all my files, I finally make it work.(Actually, it's not that hard.) I guess what makes things complicated was I had no clue why do we need to command on terminals and setup SSH key.
