## What I did
  For this project, I worked with Paula as a group to create a vignette for reading and summarizing data from pokemon API. At first, we set up a plan about our responsibilities. Then we combined our work together and discussed about our plots. We created functions allowing the users to customize their query to return specific data on pokemon. We also generated data from first 200 pokemon and all 64 berries to perform our basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Difficulties
  The first challenge we have is how to understand and use our API. Regarding to the end points, each end points contain multiple urls, and each urls will lead to another informations. All the data seems disorganized but have internal relationship. So we spent most of our time to find the connections between each end points and pick the workable ones. 
  
  The second challenge is how can we make our plots meaningful. We sure can make all sorts of plots based on the inforamtion we obtained. But we really want to make our analysis meaningful. We simplified the dual type so our plots can look little bit prettier. We discussed about the interpretation on the plots at the end. At least, all the analysis we made is quite decent.

## What I learnt
  I learnt a lot from this project. Especially when I have to deal with massive data like API, it's a definately efficient way to write down the structure of the data and try to find their relations. This method not only help you organize the intuitive thoughts, but also help a lot when you actually structure your data.
