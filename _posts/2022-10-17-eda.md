 # 1. Strategy for EDA
 
We often curious about whether our data meets the expectations. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be one of the most useful tool to answer that question. So what is EDA and what's that for?

"Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions."

# 2. Overall goal
The overall goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of data. That means, we should be able to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. 

# 3. Types and Methods of EDA
+ Univariate non-graphical 
+ Univariate graphical
  + Stem-and-leaf plots, which show all data values and the shape of the distribution.
  + Histograms, a bar plot in which each bar represents the frequency (count) or proportion (count/total count) of cases for a range of values.
  + Box plots, which graphically depict the five-number summary of minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
+ Multivariate non-graphical
+ Multivariate graphical
  + Scatter plot, which is used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis to show how much one variable is affected by another.
  + Multivariate chart, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between factors and a response.
  + Run chart, which is a line graph of data plotted over time.
  + Bubble chart, which is a data visualization that displays multiple circles (bubbles) in a two-dimensional plot.
  + Heat map, which is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color.

# 5. Things we are looking for
In general, EDA refers to performing visualizations and identifying significant patterns, such as correlated features, missing data, and outliers. To be more specific:
  + Find unique identifier
  + Check missing data
  + Categorize the data structure
  + Identify the distribution of data
  + Correlations
  + Spot outliers
