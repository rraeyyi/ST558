# Data Science

## Being a Data Scientist

A data scientist is a professional who specializes in analyzing and interpreting data. They use their data science skills to help organizations make better decisions and improve their operations. Data scientists typically have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. They use this knowledge to analyze large data sets and find trends or patterns. Additionally, data scientists may develop new ways to collect and store data.


## Major Duties & Knowledge 
Basic responsibilities include analyzing large data sets of quantitative and qualitative data. These professionals are tasked with developing statistical learning models for data analysis and must have experience using statistical tools. They must also have the required knowledge to create complex predictive models.

•	Mathematics   
•	Programming 
•	Machine learning    
•	Visualization  

## Scientists vs. Statistician
"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."  
-- by Josh Wills

While data science problems are formulated using a modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data.

## Myself..?
I see myself towards more on data scientist. I gained great communication skills from my past work experience. I can see myself better working cross-functionally as a strategic partner in the team. Thus, instead of focusing on analysis using mathematical formulas and methods by my own, I personally prefer to use technologies to provide insight information for decision making.
