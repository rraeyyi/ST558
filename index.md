Thanks for stopping by! This is Yi's GitHub blog for the class ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians. It contains few projects that I've done in this class using R. In this course, we disucussed methods for reading, manipulating, and combining data sources including databases. Computing custom functions, visualizations, and summaries using R markdown. And using R shiny for communicating results including dashboards.
