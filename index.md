Thanks for stopping by! This is Yi's GitHub blog for the class ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians.

I am a graduate student in statistics at NC State Univeristy. I obtained a master degree in Textiles from NC State University in 2017. It sounds like no relations between these two majors. (I know!) But that is exactly why I enjoy. Just like what Confucius said: They who know nothing fear nothing.
